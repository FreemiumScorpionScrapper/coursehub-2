#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Our project is a crowdsourced forum to help UofT Students choose courses. Currently, while navigating the ocean of UofT courses, you have to resort to sparse or biased sources like Reddit and word-of-mouth for suggestions. We want to help people have a more objective source of course information by aggregating over the opinions of many.  This website/webapp would provide an accessible resource for up to date course information which is constantly evolving. From our own experience, we know how overwhelmed students get when trying to find the right courses in an atmosphere which is both competitive and rapidly changing. We want to remedy this stressful situation with a trustworthy hub for all course-related information, wherein users can ask questions, get answers from more experienced students, and due to the ability to “vote” on all comments, actually trust the answers they get.

Currently we have one mockup for a single course, built by our front-end team. It can be seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/Q86CPfI.png)

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Meet our friend Billy. Billy is a high school graduate who feels overwhelmed when he reads through the vast quantity of courses offered by UofT. He tries asking his friends but they are just as lost as he is. The UofT course calendar only addresses topics that will be covered, and not the level of difficulty or personality fit of the course.  While reading online forums e.g. Reddit, he finds outdated information. With no other info sources, he chooses his courses mostly at random which leads to a suboptimal educational experience.

Meet our friend Rachel. Rachel has just finished second year and has been frustrated by the bad course suggestions she has received from her friends. Given the competitive nature of course selection at UofT, she does not want to select courses she knows it will be difficult to switch out of.
