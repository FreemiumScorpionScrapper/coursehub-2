## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Oct 11, 2018
 * Where: Bahen Centre

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Holding weekly meetings was a decision that greatly improved our productivity as we were able to discuss our ideas in person and had time to consolidate those ideas. This allowed us to prioritize ideas and features that were more important which we all agreed on.
 * Using UML and planning out our code base was a great decision as when the time comes to implement the back end, we will have a structure to follow to produce clean and maintainable code. The UML can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6DPvzWu5L10WlaltwL3CrcNGazQQ7-A/view)
 * We split up our team into three sub teams, allowing each of us to specialize and focus on areas we felt we were stronger in. Now we can more efficiently build the product, as members will be working with their strengths.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Originally in our meetings, we would all throw out our ideas at once. This was effective while we were brainstorming ideas/features but eventually it became too messy. We were wasting time and did not have a solid path to follow.
 * Due to the point listed above, we also had multiple plans and features that were not feasible. We should have decided earlier to focus on the minimal viable product rather than every possible feature.
 * Also, deciding that everyone should work as one big group did not turn out well.  We did not split up into subgroups until after a few meetings.  Since everyone was working on one part at a time, we would spend an unnecessary amount of time on certain aspects that couldâ€™ve been resolved much quicker if we had smaller teams.  There were too many people with too many ideas to be able to make good decisions quickly.  


#### Planned changes
 * We do not have any process-related changes to make.  We are happy that we decided to split into sub-groups because this decision has been working very well for us. 


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 Our goal for this deliverable was setting up the basic skeletal structure of the three most important parts of our project: [the database](https://imgur.com/a/qBAQ77n), [the UML](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6DPvzWu5L10WlaltwL3CrcNGazQQ7-A/view?usp=sharing) and the [basic UI](https://imgur.com/a/lpIvy7u).  This goal was met. We have formed the basic foundation for our project so we will be ready for future deliverables.  

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
 There were no goals that were planned but not completed.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 First we want to start by building an MVP that will have the working components of each part of the web app. This includes our front-end, back-end and also database integration. From there we will begin to implement more complex features, first adding the most important features such as allowing a question to be asked for a specific course.
 As well we will need to retrieve all of the courses from an external source so that we can have a page for each course that is offered at UofT and then have that courses associated questions, reviews etc. Having a clean and organized UI is also crucial to ensure that the user experience is optimal and so that using the web app is intuitive.
 Another important goal is to connect the front-end to back-end and ensure everything works smoothly. We have designated roles to team members, some will be working back-end and others on front-end so connecting those two will be important for functionality of the web app. Most likely at one of our weekly meetings we will come together and discuss how we will connect the two. Additionally, implementing 1/2 to 2/3 of our features for the app is another goal. As mentioned above the more important features will be implemented and integrated first. 
 
 Weekly meetings going forward will be very important to coordinate progress as well as struggles with certain aspects of implementation. Here we can help each other with problems and adjust deadlines and responsibilities accordingly. At our meetings we will allow each team member to discuss both their progress and their problems.
