## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Oct 11, 2018
 * Where: Bahen Centre

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Holding weekly meetings was a decision that greatly improved our productivity as we were able to discuss our ideas in person and had time to consolidate those ideas. This allowed us to prioritizes ideas and features that were more important which we all agreed on.
 * Using UML and planning out our code base was a great decision as when the time comes to implement the back end, we will have a structure to follow to produce clean and maintainable code. The UML can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6DPvzWu5L10WlaltwL3CrcNGazQQ7-A/view)
 * We split up our team into three sub teams which allowed each of us to specialize and focus on areas we felt we were stronger in. Now we can more efficiently build the program as each member will be working with their strengths.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Originally in our meetings, we would all throw out our ideas at once. This was effective while we were brainstorming ideas/features but eventually it became too messy. We were wasting time and did not have a solid path to follow.
 * Due to the point listed above, we also had multiple plans and features that were not feasible. If we decided earlier to focus on the minimal viable product rather than every possible features.
 * Also, deciding to not split up into sub groups earlier did not turn out well. Since everyone was working on one part at a time, we would spend an unnecessary amount of time on certain aspects which could've been resolved much quicker if we had smaller teams


#### Planned changes
 * Our next plan mainly revolves around connecting our front end to the back end and deciding the MVP. This will be the main goal of iteration 02.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
