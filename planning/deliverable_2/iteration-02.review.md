## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 31, 2018
 * Where: BA6180

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
   Our most important decision that turned out to be successful was splitting up into groups.  Our three groups were: frontend, backend and database.  This made it easier to organize the work that had to be done.  It is easier to organize a small amount of work between 2-3 people as opposed to having 6 people trying to tackle the entire project together. 
 
   Our second most important process-related decision was holding weekly group meetings in addition to the weekly tutorial.  This allowed all of the subgroups to check-in and report their progress.  We also met up within our sub-groups to report on progress and decide what needed to be done.  This decision was successful because it kept everyone up to date and ensured everyone knew exactly what their task is.

   Another important team organization decision was coding all in the same room.  When coding, we took over a room in Bahen.  This allowed us to communicate directly with each other.  Since all of our code is very interconnected it was important to be able to resolve issues and questions between different group members immediately. 


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
   Most important decision that did not turn out well: Initially, having only Labib on front-end turned out to be totally insufficient, as we underestimated the amount of work that this would be. Ultimately, Tash-had and Andrew put in many hours assisting in this part of the project while Nathan, Ted, and Cullen worked on the backend/database.

   Second-most important decision that did not turn out well:  At first, we were meeting once a week and this wasn't good enough as we needed to communicate more often and express our challenges to other team members. We then opted to meet multiple times per week. Near the end we met 3-4 times in a week to ensure the code was robust, all goals were met and the web-app was working correctly.



#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
 
   Most important process-related change that we will make: One decision that proved to be misguided was to delay coding and committing changes until the past week or so. The reason for this was because we were all busy with midterms, however in retrospect it would seem that putting in only a small amount of work on a consistent basis would have helped us have a clear focus and put us at less risk of not completing our MVP. In the future we should avoid spending more than a week without meeting and/or committing changes to the codebase.

   Another process-related change that we will make:  Initially we didnâ€™t not give team members specific enough tasks.  After our first meeting we split off into groups for the backend, frontend, and database.  From there we held meetings within our subgroups to decide specifically what everyone should do.  The only problem with this was we did not hold our meetings within our subgroups immediately after our initial meeting.  This left us with some time where group members did not know specifically what they should implement.  This wasted precious time until the deadline.  For future deliverables we will immediately assign very specific tasks to every team member.  



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 
 The most important goal that we met was completing the MVP (all code in GitHub repo): 

Implemented the database which is the basis for our source of information. This is crucial to our website as all course information and comment information is stored in it and allows proper persistence of the data. We currently have two tables one for courses and one for comments. In our final iteration we will most likely add a user database so users can create an account. 

   Set up of the backend was also important so that we have all of the logic for getting courses and comments from the database. Here the database does queries based on the information we need to acquire and give to the front-end.  We implemented the backend code based on our [UML diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6DPvzWu5L10WlaltwL3CrcNGazQQ7-A/view?usp=sharing) 
 
   The front-end is important to visualize all of the information in a clean manner for the users. We wanted to have to logic implemented first so that the front-end had all the information it needed to display the courses and comments.

Our other main goal of completing the video was completed:
	[This](link to video) is the link to our video.
	[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ct0GLvdP1TsfQiNHcfIvCtAZUAlxfRm4cf7fKQ3mErQ/edit?usp=sharing) is the link to our script.

A secondary goal that we met was meeting weekly:

   Our weekly meetings outside of tutorial were also completed and were needed to communicate our issues and successes. Without these meetings we would be left in the dark as to the true status of each part of the project and the more fine details of how the development process is going. 

Our third most important goal that we met was implementing comment and class ratings:

We added the ability to upvote/downvote a comment and implemented a basic rating system for the courses.  


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
   
   We completed all our goals that we planned.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
 
   First of all, we will implement more advanced features on top of our MVP that we have created for deliverable 2.  We will add different types of comments: replies to comments, review comments and questions with answers. Further, the aesthetic of the UI will be improved.

   In addition, for the next deliverable we will have all courses available on our web-app(not just CSC courses). As such, for deliverable three any course will be able to be searched for that is offered at UofT and then users can make questions for that course, rate it and reply to others that have questions.
