# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration XX

 * Start date: Thurs Sept 27
 * End date: Thurs Oct 11

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._ 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts youe will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

 For our first iteration, we would like to set up a full skeleton structure such that we can control information flow from text being entered into a web page, to being registered as a comment/post on a “course page” in our back-end OO model, to being entered into a database. This would allow us to have a complete framework that can be easily expanded upon in order to add more features in further iterations, rather than if we were only focusing on the back-end or front-end.

In order to achieve this, we will need to determine what languages/APIs/frameworks we will be using all the way from the database to the UI.

We will also need to implement at least 1 DB table, the UML diagram, and 1 web-page with simple interactivity (enter some text and it will show up as a “comment”).

All these components will need to be linked; this process is essential as it will be the foundation for all future features that will be added.


#### Artifacts


In order to present our project idea the artifacts we will need are the UML diagram, the basic database setup, and 1 web-page with simple interactivity.  

In the UML diagram we will outline the basic structure of all the basic classes that we need to build the MVP.  This artifact will be useful because it will give us an organized structure to follow when coding the back-end.  

We will also need the basic database setup so that we will be ready with the basic structure/plan of our 3 important parts of our project (front end, back end, database).  

Our third artifact will be the web-page with simple interactivity.  We will create one course with the ability to add a comment.  Again, this artifact is important because it creates the basis of one of our 3 main components of our project.
