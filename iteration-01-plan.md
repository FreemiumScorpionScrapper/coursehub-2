# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration XX

 * Start date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU HAD YOUR FIRST TEAM PLANNING MEETING
 * End date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ARE PLANNING TO HAVE YOUR REVIEW MEETING

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._ 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts youe will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

 For our first iteration, we would like to set up a full skeleton structure such that we can control information flow from text being entered into a web page, to being registered as a comment/post on a “course page” in our back-end OO model, to being entered into a database. This would allow us to have a complete framework that can be easily expanded upon in order to add more features in further iterations, rather than if we were only focusing on the back-end or front-end.

In order to achieve this, we will need to determine what languages/APIs/frameworks we will be using all the way from the database to the UI.

We will also need to implement at least 1 DB table, the UML diagram, and 1 web-page with simple interactivity (enter some text and it will show up as a “comment”).

All these components will need to be linked; this process is essential as it will be the foundation for all future features that will be added.


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
